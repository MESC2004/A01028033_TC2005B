# Activity 4.3.1 Basic Videogame Concepts

For this activity, a unity project containing a pong and a simon says game was created.

## Title Screen
The title screen has 3 buttons, each will take you to the respective section upon being clicked.

## PONG
The pong game will start as soon as the scene is loaded from clicking the pong button in the menu. 
### Controls
- The left paddle can be controlled with the D and F keys for moving up and down.
- The right paddle can be controlled with the J and K keys for moving up and down as well.
### Score and exiting
- Each time a goal is scored, a point is awarded to the player opposite of the goal the ball went into.
- The game can be restarted with the R key, and you can return to the title screen by clicking the title button in the bottom of the screen.

## Simon Says
Similar to the pong game, a simon says game will start as soon as the button in the title screen is pressed. 
### Goal
- This game will challenge the player to replicate a sequence of button presses, adding a new button to press in the sequence by 1 each time the player succesfully replicates it.

### Controls
- The interactions with the buttons are made through clicks, and little by little the button combination gets faster by a little. The speed gets reset every time you lose or reset the game.
- You can restart the game at any point by clicking the restart game button, and return to the title screen by clicking the title button.
- There is a limit of 3 seconds between each button press. If you take longer than 3 seconds between clicks you will lose. Be careful!
- Try to get the highest score you can!
